## Proposal Summary
I propose the Boss DAO utilizes 15,000 ADA of treasury funds to invest into Project 2090. These funds would be used to purchase both Cyborgs and Biochips:
- 1 Tier 1 2090 Biochip.......................4,000 ADA
- 65 Floor Cyborgs...............................6,500 ADA (65 cyborgs with an avg cost of 100 )
- 10 Cyborgs with rare traits.............2,500 ADA (10 cyborgs with an avg cost of 250)
- 25 Biochips...........................................2,000 ADA (25 Biochips with an avg cost of 80)


## Proposal Details
Boss DAO stands to gain a lot from investing into such a solid project like Project 2090. Project 2090 has proven itself time and time again and currently sits 3x higher than the minting price. It is also important to note that Project 2090 is an official partner with Ghostchain and Freeroam. You can see this in some of the traits of the cyborgs (freeroam jacket, ghostchain hair, etc.) Project 2090 has ambitious plans for future growth and development including designing a virtual world and 3D models to integrate into an existing Metaverse. Project 2090 is partnered with 3D virtual world builder, Muse as well as Spacetime Metaverse.  

**Infection Information**
- Project 2090 is currently undergoing its infection process. 
- The total supply of infected cyborgs will be 1,113, reducing the OG supply to 4,442. OG cyborgs will be burned if infected.
- These infections will happen in one of two ways, either by random infection or via Biochip.

- Starting on April 10th, cyborgs will start to be randomly infected. The infection is not automatic as holders will be able to choose whether or not they want their cyborg to be infected or not. This is why it is crucial that Boss DAO sweeps the floor of Project 2090.
   - Week 1 - 15 infected
   - Week 2 - 25 infected
   - Week 3 - 35 infected
   - Week 4 - 45 infected
   - Week 5 - 55 infected
   - Week 6 - 65 infected
   - Week 7 - 75 infected
   - Week 8 - 85 infected
   - Week 9 - 100 infected

It's important to note that all of these are customizeable traits that holders of these cyborgs will get to pick on their own. The holder essentially gets to create their own NFT. I haven't really seen any mutation process quite like this. Below is a list of the different infections and tiers. 

- Tier 1 (black):
    3 customizable infected traits.
    The eyes trait will be optional.
    Uncommon Entheos animated background 

- Tier 2 (silver/grey):
    2 customizable infected traits. 
    The eyes and body trait will be optional.
    Common Entheos animated background 

- Tier 3 (red, green, blue):
    2 customizable infected traits.
    The eyes and body trait will be optional.
    Rare Entheos static background 

- Tier 4 (red, green, blue, yellow): 
    2 customizable infected traits.
    The eyes and body trait will be optional.
    Uncommon Entheos static background 

- Tier 5 (red, green, blue, yellow, purple): 
    2 customizable infected traits. 
    The eyes trait will be optional.
    Common Entheos static background 

**Tier 1 Biochip**  
- Buying a Tier 1 Biochip is the highest priority on this list. 
- Only 10 Tier 1 chips will ever exist, and one is currently listed for 4,000 ADA
    - If there are no Tier 1 chips on the market once this proposal is approved, funds will be used to buy a Tier 2 chip. Tier 2 chips give royalties as well, but they are less in comparison to tier 1. There are 45 Tier 2 chips. If we end up buying a Tier 2 chip, the rest of the allocated 4,000 ADA would go to sweeping the cyborg floor.
- Holding a Tier 1 chip will provide passive income to the Boss DAO (This income compounds with every cyborg held.)  
- We will be able to be use the biochip to create an infected Tier 1 cyborg (The community will vote on which cyborg in the DAO treasury to use for this infection.) (This does not destroy the Tier 1 chip.)

**Floor Cyborgs**
- Boss DAO will buy 65 2090 Cyborgs with an average cost of 100.
- It is vital that Boss DAO sweeps the floor after obtaining a Tier 1 biochip because the more cyborgs that are in the treasury, the higher the 2090 royalty payout will be. 

**Rare Trait Cyborgs**
- 2,500 ADA would be allocated to buy 10 cyborgs with rare traits and the community will vote on which traits are preferred to have in the treasury.
- Project 2090 is known for its' amazing art and attention to detail. Boss DAO's artist, Mac, also did work on Project 2090. There are many rare traits in the project that are becoming scarcer including, but not limited to the freeroam/ghostchain traits. 
- Here are some of the rare traits.
      - GhostChain x FreeRoam Jacket
          - 6/105 listed
      - Futuristic Puffer Jacket
          - 4/83 listed
      - Freeroam Bubble Gum
          - 12/91 listed
      - GhostChain x FreeRoam Hair
          - 16/152 listed
      - Digi land Background
          - 6/85 listed
          
**Biochips**
- Boss DAO will buy 25 Biochips with an average cost of 80 ADA.
- Only 555 Biochips were minted, and no more will ever be created.
- When people use biochips to infect their cyborgs, the supply will start to go down. 
- I think it would be in Boss DAO's best interest to buy varying chips to either use on our own cyborgs or sell later when they become super scarce. This will be voted on at a later date.

I would recommend anyone considering voting for this proposal to check out Twitter link below as well as the Virus Infection Cuztomization Preview page on their website. This will make it easier to visualize how the infection process works.
