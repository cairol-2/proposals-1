**Proposal Summary**
I propose the Boss DAO utilizes $7.5K ADA of treasury funds to sweep the VeggieMates floor in order to invest before their token $Greens and season 2 collection drops. No date for the drops have been announced yet but will soon so it's better to snatch them now at a discount price before the team reveals dates.

**Proposal Details**

• The primary use of $Greens will be to fuel the Virtually Made entertainment ecosystem (The brand behind the whole veggiemates project), this ecosystem is going to be the "Adult Swim" network of the Cardano community. 

• $Greens will be the game currency in the VeggieMates vs. Junkies game which is a P2E game launching soon.
Junkies is the season 2 NFT collection that features junk food only i.e. french fries, burgers, pizza, etc.

• The concept and art is exceptional IMO, quality artwork, some with fun and intense images of fuck you's/flipping fingers and such. Not to mention, for each veggie you own you can mint one junky NFT (Season2). Artist Robotlim has been drawing for 30 years.

• The community is solid, and the team are very active in the CNFT community, they do events on discord and twitter on a regular basis, they host and join twitter spaces on the regular doing collabs with many other cool projects.

• The team is composed of business, crypto, marketing and business professionals with influence in the space. Among them, Paul Thomas a.k.a. Big PT from Good Charlotte is the chief blockchain consultant and Brian Stivers a.k.a. Beastives is the leader of the project and also has real world business experience, he is currently the senior manager of solutions engineering at the company DocuSign. Links at the end of the proposal to read about the rest of the team.

It would be smart to sweep the floor now before the team releases the dates (Which it will happen any day now!) for when they are launching their $Greens token and Season 2 Junkies collection. Not to mention the floor is in the 70's, a really good price for entry.

• Token staking, NFT staking and P2E game in the horizon. 

I highly recommend you read through both of their whitepapers before you cast your vote. The links are below.
