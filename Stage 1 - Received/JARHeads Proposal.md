**Example 1:**

I propose the DAO use 5,000 ADA fromt he treasury to purchase up to 250 JARHeads

JARHeads is a collecion of 2,999 hand painted art pieces by the artist "JAR".  Each piece is completely unique and made up from thousands of different traits paitned by the artist.  The collection has done almost 1,000,000A in volume on jpg store since mint in February.  All time high sale has reached 3,000A and several of the pieces are being sold at auction for over 1,500A on a weekly basis.

Recently the floor has dipped to ~200A which creates an enticing entry point for someone to get in and take ownership of these fine art pieces which will continue to increase in long term value.

It is important to note that this project does not use rankings or rarity, it is art created by the artist and all rights are owned by the holders of the NFTs. While certain traits favored by the comunity have traded for higher all time highs, the concept of no ranking plays well for the DAO as many could be collected at floor price.
